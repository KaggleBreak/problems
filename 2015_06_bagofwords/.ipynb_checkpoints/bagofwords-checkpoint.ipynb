    "##Bag of Words\n",
    "- (computer science) The collection of words from an unprocessed text without regard to grammar.\n",
    "- In computer vision, the bag-of-words model (BoW model) can be applied to image classification, by treating image features as words. In document classification, a bag of words is a sparse vector of occurrence counts of words; that is, a sparse histogram over the vocabulary. In computer vision, a bag of visual words is a vector of occurrence counts of a vocabulary of local image features.\n",

    "##What is NLP?\n",
    "- NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a set of techniques for approaching text problems. This page will help you get started with loading and cleaning the IMDB movie reviews, then applying a simple Bag of Words model to get surprisingly accurate predictions of whether a review is thumbs-up or thumbs-down.\n",

    "> ###**Data Set**\n",
    " + The labeled data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.\n",

    " + unlabeledTrainData.tsv : An extra training set with no labels. The tab-delimited file has a header row followed by 50,000 rows containing an id and text for each review. \n",
    " + testData.tsv : The test set. The tab-delimited file has a header row followed by 25,000 rows containing an id and text for each review. Your task is to predict the sentiment for each one. \n",

On the other hand, in this case, we are tackling a sentiment analysis problem, and it is possible that \"!!!\" or \":-(\" could carry sentiment, and should be treated as words. In this tutorial, for simplicity, we remove the punctuation altogether, but it is something you can play with on your own.\n",

    "- Finally, we need to decide how to deal with frequently occurring words that don't carry much meaning. Such words are called \"stop words\"; in English they include words such as \"a\", \"and\", \"is\", and \"the\". Conveniently, there are Python packages that come with stop word lists built in. Let's import a stop word list from the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). You'll need to install the library if you don't already have it on your computer; you'll also need to install the data packages that come with it, as follows:\n",
    "- Don't worry about the \"u\" before each word; it just indicates that Python is internally representing each word as a unicode string.\n",
    "- There are many other things we could do to the data - For example, Porter Stemming and Lemmatizing (both available in NLTK) would allow us to treat \"messages\", \"message\", and \"messaging\" as the same word, which could certainly be useful. However, for simplicity, the tutorial will stop here."

    "##Creating Features from a Bag of Words (Using scikit-learn)\n",
    "- Now that we have our training reviews tidied up, how do we convert them to some kind of numeric representation for machine learning? One common approach is called a Bag of Words. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "- Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n",
    "- Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n",
    "- From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows: { the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "- To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "- { the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "- Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n",
    "- Similarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n",
    "- In the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary. To limit the size of the feature vectors, we should choose some maximum vocabulary size. Below, we use the 5000 most frequent words (remembering that stop words have already been removed)."

    "- At this point, we have numeric training features from the Bag of Words and the original sentiment labels for each feature vector, so let's do some supervised learning! Here, we'll use the Random Forest classifier that we introduced in the Titanic tutorial.  The Random Forest algorithm is included in scikit-learn (Random Forest uses many tree-based classifiers to make predictions, hence the \"forest\"). Below, we set the number of trees to 100 as a reasonable default value. More trees may (or may not) perform better, but will certainly take longer to run. Likewise, the more features you include for each review, the longer this will take."

    "##Introducing Distributed Word Vectors\n",
    "- This part of the tutorial will focus on using distributed word vectors created by the Word2Vec algorithm. (For an overview of deep learning, as well as pointers to some additional tutorials, see the \"What is Deep Learning?\" page).\n",
    "- Parts 2 and 3 assume more familiarity with Python than Part 1. We developed the following code on a dual-core Macbook Pro, however, we have not yet run the code successfully on Windows. If you are a Windows user and you get it working, please leave a note on how you did it in the forum! For more detail, see the \"Setting Up Your System\" page.\n",
    "- Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "- Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "- Check out Google's code, writeup, and the accompanying papers. This presentation is also helpful. The original code is in C, but it has since been ported to other languages, including Python. We encourage you to play with the original C tool, but be warned that it is not user-friendly if you are a beginning programmer (we had to manually edit the header files to compile it).\n",
    "- Recent work out of Stanford has also applied deep learning to sentiment analysis; their code is available in Java. However, their approach, which relies on sentence parsing, cannot be applied in a straightforward way to paragraphs of arbitrary length.\n",
    "- Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis."

    "##Using word2vec in Python\n",
    "- In Python, we will use the excellent implementation of word2vec from the gensim package. If you don't already have gensim installed, you'll need to install it. There is an excellent tutorial that accompanies the Python Word2Vec implementation, here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). ln order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install cython (instructions here). Word2Vec will run without cython installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing to Train a Model\n",
    "- Now down to the nitty-gritty! First, we read in the data with pandas, as we did in Part 1. Unlike Part 1, we now use unlabeledTrain.tsv, which contains 50,000 additional reviews with no labels. When we built the Bag of Words model in Part 1, extra unlabeled training reviews were not useful. However, since Word2Vec can learn from unlabeled data, these extra 50,000 reviews can now be used."

    "##Training and Saving Your Model\n",
    "- With the list of nicely parsed sentences, we're ready to train the model. There are a number of parameter choices that affect the run time and the quality of the final model that is produced. For details on the algorithms below, see the word2vec API documentation as well as the Google documentation. \n",
    "  - Architecture: Architecture options are skip-gram (default) or continuous bag of words. We found that skip-gram was very slightly slower but produced better results.\n",
    "  - Training algorithm: Hierarchical softmax (default) or negative sampling. For us, the default worked well.\n",
    "  - Downsampling of frequent words: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\n",
    "  - Word vector dimensionality: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n",
    "  - Context / window size: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n",
    "  - Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n",
    "  - Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles. This resulted in an overall vocabulary size of around 15,000 words. Higher values also help limit run time.\n"

Grouping vectors in this way is known as \"vector quantization.\" To accomplish this, we first need to find the centers of the word clusters, which we can do by using a clustering algorithm such as K-Means.\n",
    "- In K-Means, the one parameter we need to set is \"K,\" or the number of clusters. How should we decide how many clusters to create? Trial and error suggested that small clusters, with an average of only 5 words or so per cluster, gave better results than large clusters with many words. Clustering code is given below. We use scikit-learn to perform our K-Means.\n",

    "##You may ask: Why is Bag of Words better?\n",
    "- The biggest reason is, in our tutorial, averaging the vectors and using the centroids lose the order of words, making it very similar to the concept of Bag of Words. The fact that the performance is similar (within range of standard error) makes all three methods practically equivalent.  \n",
    " \n",
    "##A few things to try:\n",
    "- First, training Word2Vec on a lot more text should greatly improve performance. Google's results are based on word vectors that were learned out of more than a billion-word corpus; our labeled and unlabeled training sets together are only a measly 18 million words or so. Conveniently, Word2Vec provides functions to load any pre-trained model that is output by Google's original C tool, so it's also possible to train a model in C and then import it into Python.\n",
    "- Second, in published literature, distributed word vector techniques have been shown to outperform Bag of Words models. In this paper, an algorithm called Paragraph Vector is used on the IMDB dataset to produce some of the most state-of-the-art results to date. In part, it does better than the approaches we try here because vector averaging and clustering lose the word order, whereas Paragraph Vectors preserves word order information."
